    <p>A while ago the company I work for moved to our new office. A couple of printers were left behind so me and a couple of colleges&nbsp;saw it as our duty to go Office Space on it.</p>
    <p>I think it makes much more sence if you have seen the movie <a title="Office Space" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/" target="_blank">Office Space</a>. I even dare to say you will think what we do is really silly if you have'nt.</p>
    <p>The movie is shoot with four iPhone 4 and edited in Adobe Premiere Pro.&nbsp;Althou it is shot in one take, without any script or rehersal what so ever, it turned out pretty good. For a prank that is.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The best part is that we sent the printer to our service desk with a port-it saying "There is something wrong with the printer, could you take a look at it? Thanks".</p>
