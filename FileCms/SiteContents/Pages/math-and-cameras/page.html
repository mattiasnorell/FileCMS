    <h1>Math and cameras</h1>

    <p>I started out by playing with some mathstuff like this, took a detur through flash.media.Camera and ended up with a fusion between the two. And, yea, you need Flash.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">window.swfobject || document.write("<script src='http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/swfobject/2.2/swfobject.js'>\x3C/script>")</script>

    <div id="flash-holder"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var flashvars = {};
        var params = {};
        var attributes = {};
        swfobject.embedSWF("{PAGE_PATH}mathandcameras.swf", "flash-holder", "680", "400", "9.0.0", "", flashvars, params, attributes);
    </script>
